    echo "Usage: ${0##*/} [-f] APPLICATION [PARAMETERS ...]
Launches a windowed session in Chromium OS for any graphical application.
All parameters are passed to the specified application.

xiwi will normally close when the application returns. Some gui applications
fork before or during normal operation, which can confuse xiwi and cause it to
quit prematurely. If your application does not have a parameter that prevents
it from forking, you can use -f to prevent xiwi from quitting automatically.
You will need to Ctrl-C xiwi in the terminal to make it quit.

A default window manager will full-screen all windows, unless APPLICATION begins
with 'start'. You can cycle through multiple windows inside the application via
Ctrl-Alt-Tab/Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Tab, or close them via Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Escape.
If APPLICATION begins with 'start' but you still want to use the default window
manager, specify the full path of the application." 1>&2
